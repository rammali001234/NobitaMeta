# 👻 nobitameta v4.0 — Advanced Forensics & Anonymization Console

![banner](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20By-NOBITA%20Academy-%23a855f7)
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-4.0-38bdf8)
![GUI](https://img.shields.io/badge/GUI-Electron%20%2B%20Flask-blue)
![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-success)

**nobitameta** is a metadata forensics and privacy-scrubbing engine built by
**NOBITA Academy**. v4.0 rebuilds it as a full desktop GUI application — the
same engine, same offline-first philosophy, now with a proper HUD console
instead of a bare terminal menu.

The architecture mirrors [Glacier](https://github.com/NOBITA-academy),
NOBITA Academy's flagship pentesting toolkit: a small local Flask API doing
the real work, and an Electron shell providing a native desktop window and
file-system dialogs around it.

## ⚡ What's new in v4.0 (GUI Edition)

- **Native desktop app** — Electron HUD with a dark, HUD-styled console
  instead of a raw terminal menu. Native file/folder pickers, no uploads.
- **Composite risk scoring** — every extracted tag is classified
  Critical / High / Medium / Low and rolled into an overall exposure score,
  not just a flat "risky/not risky" flag.
- **Dashboard** — at-a-glance counters for critical findings, files cleaned,
  and recent activity across the whole session.
- **Reports & History panes** — every analysis report and every operation
  (analyze, GPS lookup, scrub, bulk scrub) is logged locally and browsable.
- **Still 100% offline.** The Flask API only ever binds to `127.0.0.1`; no
  data leaves the device.
- The original terminal tool, `nobitameta.sh`, is kept as-is for headless /
  Termux / SSH use.

## 🧠 Core Capabilities

| Module | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Deep Analysis** | Full metadata extraction via `exiftool`, risk-classified per tag, exported as a styled HTML report. |
| **GPS Forensics** | Pulls exact capture coordinates (+ altitude, direction, timestamp, speed) and links straight to Google Maps. |
| **Secure Scrub** | Strips all metadata from a file. Original is always backed up first, cleaned copy written separately. |
| **Bulk Scrub** | Sanitizes every file in a folder in one pass, with a per-file pass/fail breakdown. |
| **Reports** | Browse every HTML report nobitameta has generated this install. |
| **History** | Local audit log of every operation run, with timestamps and risk outcomes. |

## 🚀 Installation & Usage (GUI)

Requires Python 3.9+, Node.js/npm, and `exiftool`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rammali001234/nobitameta.git
cd nobitameta

./setup.sh   # one-time: installs exiftool (if missing), Python venv, Electron deps
./start.sh   # launches the API + opens the nobitameta HUD window
```

`start.sh` uses `tmux` to run the API server and the Electron HUD side by
side if `tmux` is available; otherwise it starts the API in the background
and launches the HUD in the foreground.

Inside the app: pick a file with **Browse…**, run the operation, and the
result — risk report, GPS pin, cleaned file, or bulk summary — renders right
in the console. **Reveal in Folder** and **Open Report** buttons hand off to
your OS file manager / browser directly via Electron, so nothing has to be
manually copied out of a temp directory.

### Manual (no tmux)

```bash
# Terminal 1
cd server && ../venv/bin/python3 server.py

# Terminal 2
cd hud && npm start
```

### Install as a desktop app (Kali / Debian-based)

Prefer a proper Applications-menu entry and a `nobitameta` terminal command
over running it from the cloned repo each time? Use the installer instead
of `setup.sh`/`start.sh`:

```bash
./packaging/install.sh     # installs to ~/.local/share/nobitameta, adds
                            # a menu entry, an icon, and a `nobitameta` command
nobitameta                  # launch it from anywhere

./packaging/uninstall.sh   # removes everything the installer created
```

See `packaging/README.md` for exactly what gets installed where.

## 🖥️ Installation & Usage (classic terminal tool)

The original bash tool still works standalone — handy for Termux, headless
boxes, or SSH sessions where a GUI isn't an option:

```bash
chmod +x nobitameta.sh
./nobitameta.sh
```

See the in-app menu for Deep Analysis, GPS Forensics, Secure Scrub, and
Bulk Scrub — identical feature set to the GUI, terminal-only.

## 🧭 Use Cases

1. **OSINT Investigations** — pinpoint exactly where a photo was taken.
2. **Privacy Protection** — scrub GPS/device metadata before posting online.
3. **Forensic Analysis** — spot signs of editing, identify device/software
   fingerprints left behind in a file.
